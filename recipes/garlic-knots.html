        Although I don't go there often nowadays, this recipe satisfies my craving for garlic bread when it comes up.

        <li>1/4 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Garlic Topping</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon melted butter</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Combine flour, yogurt, garlic granules, Italian seasoning, and salt in a bowl; mix to combine.</li>
        <li>
          Dust work surface with more flour. Transfer dough to work surface. Knead dough for 8 to 10 minutes with the
          palm of your hand. Add more flour (1 teaspoon at a time) as needed to keep dough from being too sticky.
        </li>
        <li>
          Preheat the oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone
          baking mat (such as Silpat®).
        </li>
        <li>
          Shape dough into a rounded loaf. Using a bench scraper, cut off 8 wedges of dough. Roll each wedge of dough
          into a rope shape and tie into knots. Place knots onto the prepared baking sheet.
        </li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until knots are lightly browned, 10 to 12 minutes.</li>
        <li>
          Meanwhile, combine melted butter, oil, garlic granules, and parsley for topping in a small glass bowl. Brush
          mixture over the warm knots.
        </li>
      </ol>
