    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This cheesecake recipe gets its name from its "burnt" outer layer as a
      result of being baked in a hot oven. Don't be fooled: The inner layer is
      still as delicious, if not better due to the contrasting outer layer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The original recipe was created in the 1970s in the Spanish city of San
      Sebastian.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 tablespoon soft unsalted butter, or as needed</li>
      <li>parchment paper</li>
      <li>3 (8 ounce) packages cream cheese, softened</li>
      <li>1 cup white sugar</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon fine salt</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
      <li>4 jumbo eggs, at room temperature</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups heavy cream</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Butter a 9-inch cake pan. Cut a sheet of parchment paper large enough to
        line the inside of the pan by a few extra inches. Butter the paper and
        press it into the pan, flattening any major creases. Trim away any
        excess paper from the sides until you have an inch or two of overhang.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Combine cream cheese, sugar, flour, and salt in a bowl; stir and smear
        together with a spatula until very smooth and creamy.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Add vanilla and 1 egg; whisk to combine. Whisk in remaining eggs, one at
        a time. Pour in heavy cream and mix until smooth.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Pour batter into the prepared pan. Tap the pan against the counter to
        burst any excess air bubbles.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until puffed, very well browned, and nearly
        burned on the edges, 50 to 55 minutes. Increase oven temperature to 425
        degrees F (220 degrees C) for the last 10 minutes.
      </li>
      <br />
      <li>
        Let cheesecake cool to room temperature, at least 25 minutes. Lift out
        onto a plate and peel back parchment paper, using a knife or spatula if
        needed. Refrigerate until thoroughly chilled, 4 hours to overnight.
      </li>
    </ol>
