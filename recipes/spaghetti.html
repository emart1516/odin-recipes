    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      If you're like me, you're someone who likes to eat healthy
      <em>and</em> tasty meals, but you don't always have time to cook. Sometimes, you want to break away from your
      typical protein, rice, and veggie meal, but you don't want to spend more than your usual time cooking.
    </p>
    <p>
      Enter: the Easy Spaghetti Recipe. This meal is ready in just under an hour, and although there's nothing quite
      like Mom's spaghetti, this recipe comes darn close.
